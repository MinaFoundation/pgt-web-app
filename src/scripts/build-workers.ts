/**
 * Build Script for Bree.js Workers
 *
 * This script compiles TypeScript worker files into JavaScript for use with Bree.js job scheduler.
 * It's necessary because:
 *
 * 1. Bree.js workers run in separate threads using Node.js worker_threads
 * 2. Worker files need to be compiled from TypeScript to JavaScript before execution
 * 3. Workers need special ESM handling since our project uses "type": "module"
 *
 * Project Structure:
 * - Source workers are in src/tasks/*.ts
 * - Compiled workers are output to dist/tasks/*.js
 *
 * Worker Configuration:
 * - Workers are initialized in src/app/api/proposals/[id]/submit/route.ts
 * - Bree is configured to look for workers in dist/tasks/
 * - Each worker runs in isolation with its own dependencies
 *
 * Build Process:
 * 1. Bundles each worker file with its dependencies
 * 2. Adds ESM compatibility layer via banner
 * 3. Outputs compiled files to dist/tasks/
 *
 * @example
 * # Build workers (usually run as part of npm run build)
 * npm run build:workers
